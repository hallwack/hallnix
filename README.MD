# hallnix

Welcome to my **hallnix** setup!  
This is my personal collection of NixOS configurations, scripts, and dotfiles—painstakingly tweaked, occasionally broken, and always evolving. If you’re looking for a pristine, minimal, or “best practices” repo, you’re in the wrong place. Here, you’ll find a living archive of hacks, experiments, and the occasional stroke of genius.

I keep things working (most of the time), but don’t expect everything to be clean or well-documented. It’s a ricer’s playground: patched together, full of comments to my future self, and always under construction.  
Oh, and a heads-up: Hyprland configs are here, but they’re not fully working yet—expect weirdness, missing features, and plenty of TODOs. I’m still poking at it between other experiments, so don’t be surprised if things break (or just don’t launch at all).

## Specifications

- **OS:** NixOS (unstable channel, mostly)
- **Hardware:** ThinkPad T480 (i5-8350U, 16GB RAM, Intel UHD 620)
- **Window Managers:** Hyprland (WIP), i3-gaps (fallback)
- **Shell:** fish
- **Editor:** Neovim
- **Terminal:** kitty
- **Other tools:** waybar, dunst, mako, zathura, firefox, and a rotating cast of utilities

Expect configs to be tailored for my hardware and workflow, but feel free to poke around or adapt anything you find useful!

P.S. I'm using that readme using copilot.
